# Quick Reference: Stuck Processing Fix

## ✅ Updated Files

```
client_processor_robust.py  ← NEW: Robust processor with timeout
data_pipeline_ui.py         ← UPDATED: Now uses RobustClientProcessor
```

## 🚀 How to Use

```bash
streamlit run data_pipeline_ui.py
```

Go to: **Stage 2 → JSON Extraction**

## ⚙️ Recommended Settings

```
Concurrent Workers:        4
Timeout per file:          120 seconds
Max retries:              1
```

## 📊 New Metrics

| Metric | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| ⏱️ **Timeout** | Files that took too long (>120s) |
| 🔥 **Corrupted** | Files with invalid format |
| 📄 **Current** | File being processed right now |

## ⚡ What This Fixes

**Before:**
```
Progress: 847/2000
[STUCK - infinite hang]
→ Kill process
→ Restart manually
```

**After:**
```
Progress: 847/2000
📄 Current: bad_file.xlsx
... 120 seconds pass ...
⏱️ Timeout: 1 - Skipping!
Progress: 848/2000 - Continuing...
→ Auto-continues
→ 99%+ success rate
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

**For 2000 files:**
- ✅ Processed: ~1995-1999
- ❌ Failed: 1-5 (logged for review)
- ⏱️ Timeout: 1-3 (bad files)
- ⏱ Time: 5-8 minutes
- 📋 Success: 99%+

## 🔧 If Files Timeout

After processing, check the expandable:
```
⚠️ 3 Files Timed Out
  - /path/to/file1.xlsx
  - /path/to/file2.xlsx
  - /path/to/file3.xlsx
```

**Options:**
1. **Increase timeout** to 300s and reprocess
2. **Fix file** in Excel and reprocess
3. **Skip** if not critical

## 📝 Quick Test

**Test if file is corrupted:**
```bash
python -c "import openpyxl; openpyxl.load_workbook('file.xlsx')"
```

**If it hangs:** File is corrupted
**If it errors:** File has issues
**If it works:** File is just slow → increase timeout

## 🎉 Bottom Line

**One bad file won't stop your entire pipeline!**

- Auto-timeout after 120s
- Auto-retry failed files
- Auto-continue processing
- Zero manual intervention

Just launch and go! ✨
